    "short_description": "DC Motor 26 Click is a compact add-on board with a brushed DC motor driver. This board features the TB9053FTG, a PWM-type, dual-channel, H-bridge, brushed DC motor driver from Toshiba Semiconductor. The TB9053FTG is rated for an operating voltage range from 4.5V to 28V, with the motor controlled directly through a PWM signal or SPI serial interface. In addition, this driver allows a dual configuration with two motors with 5A current ratings per channel or one 10A channel drive in a Parallel mode of operation. It also has complete diagnostic and protection capabilities supporting robust and reliable operation.",
