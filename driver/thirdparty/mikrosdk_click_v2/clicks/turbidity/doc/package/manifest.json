    "short_description": "Turbidity Click is an adapter Click boardâ„¢, used to interface a compatible turbidity sensor with the host MCU. This board features one 1x3 2.5mm connector suitable for connecting a TSD-10 Turbidity Sensor via an additional 3-wire cable for Turbidity Click specially made for this purpose. It allows users to upgrade their projects with a sensor that senses the cloudiness or haziness of a fluid caused by large numbers of individual particles invisible to the naked eye. This sensor also measures temperature as well as turbidity.",
